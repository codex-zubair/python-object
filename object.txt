OBject Types

1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.


First value initialize inside an constructor 
Then pass the class in another class  (inside of it):

and call the def __init__(self): 
constructor.



2. Abstraction

 process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user



# class parent_class:
# body of parent class

# class child_class( parent_class):
# body of child class



3. Inheritance

Calling the object inside the object file




4. Polymorphism
