OBject Types

1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.


First value initialize inside an constructor 
Then pass the class in another class  (inside of it):

and call the def __init__(self): 
constructor.



2. Abstraction

 process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user



# class parent_class:
# body of parent class

# class child_class( parent_class):
# body of child class



3. Inheritance

Calling the object inside the object file




4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism in python defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. Also, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class.



depends on input whatever needs to run. using one block of code and changing which version of code will be used depending on user input

Take input and do whatever they needs to do work...
like   object.math(a,b);
